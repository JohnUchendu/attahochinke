          Why Aviation Law is Important
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          Aviation law ensures the safety, security, and regulation of air
          travel. It governs aircraft operations, passenger rights, airport
          usage, and international airspace. With the complexity of global air
          transport, strong legal frameworks are essential for accident
          prevention, dispute resolution, and compliance with international
          aviation standards. It supports smooth airline operations and protects
          both carriers and passengers.
